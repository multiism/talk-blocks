# Block Ideas

<!-- This document could use some structure. -->

* :rainbow: Color words can be painted their colors
* :sunny: Concrete nouns (e.g. "sun") can be painted with pictures of the objects
* :maple_leaf: A "leaf" block could be painted or could have leaves embedded under a coat of finish
* :palm_tree: A "palm" block could be made out of palm wood (although the word can of course also refer to the palm of a hand)
* :white_large_square: A "clear" block could be made of clear plastic
* :droplet: a "water" block could be the same, with the insides waterproof and filled with water part way or all the way but mixed with particles to show the fluidity
* :large_orange_diamond: An "amber" block could be [molded out of amber resin][amber molding]
* :eyes: "eyes" could have googly eyes attached ("watched", "saw")
* :sparkles: "starry", "stars", or "night" could be painted, or...* they could made to light up with [fiber optics][]!
* :high_brightness: "light", "bright", or "glow" blocks could be made with transparent diffused plastic with LEDs inside
* I could imagine a "slinky" block, but that wouldn't be that useful of a word... relative to how fun the block itself could be
* :whale: I can imagine an artistic cuboidal "whale" block with a spout
* :spades: "spades", "clubs", "diamonds", "hearts", and "cards" could be plastered with playing cards, or could be intricately designed in the style of playing cards
* "stuffed" or "plushie" could be plushie cuboids (like [this][cuboid plushies] but not necessarily animalian)
* Many words can include typographical stylizations, e.g. faint, sloppy, **bold**, *fast*/*run*/*italic*/*slanted*, **R***A*nS**o**m (probably don't need this one in a children's toy), <sup>high,</sup> <sub>low</sub>
* "high" and "low" could be superscript and subscript respectively, but they could also be higher and lower respectively
* ▛ A (preferably 3D) quadrant of "quarter" could be inverted or highlighted, maybe even made out of a different type of wood
* :bell: "bells" could contain bells
* :hotsprings: "smell" could have symbolic wavy markings and/or could be scented
* :cow2: "cow" could have a cow pattern (or be a plushie!)
* "crib" could be a miniature crib, with the word set at the bottom or possibly atop some adorable bedding
* :closed_lock_with_key: "lock" could be a locked container and "key" could have the key on a string
* :bus: "bus" could be a miniature bus, with wheels, even
* :white_square_button: "internal" could have the word on the inside, at the bottom of a clear plastic block with the wiring moved away from the center, or better yet with a smaller opaque block inside
* :checkered_flag: "checkered" can be checkered
* :crown: "crown" can be jeweled and ornamented
* :closed_book: "book" can be an actual (small) book, with the wiring going through the binding or bottom cover
* :traffic_light: "traffic" can have a few colored lights
* :bread: "bread" can be shaped like a loaf of bread
* :small_red_triangle: "laser" can be clear plastic with a lit up central tube, or alternatively it could actually use a laser to carry the information. It would need a direct channel for power anyways, though, so it would be very silly.
* "mechanical" can use a mechanically inspired font or actually incorporate gears and widgets for a 
* "heavy" can be physically heavy, "light" can be physically light (and their type can be adjusted as well)
* "clunky" or "misfit" could be awkwardly different sizes
* ¶ line/paragraph break connectors that could basically just be cords with the magnets and contacts (or maybe something nicer if possible)
* :twisted_rightwards_arrows: splitting and joining connectors that let you give the sentences different possible paths at the same time (The brain could then read out load)
* :on: "'s" and "s" blocks, and other postfixes and prefixes like "-ness" and "super-" (I'm not sure exactly how these will work typographimechanically)
