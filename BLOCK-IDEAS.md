# Block Ideas

* :rainbow: Color words can be painted their colors
* :sunny: Concrete nouns (e.g. "sun") can be painted with pictures of the objects


### Material

* :palm_tree: A "palm" block could be made out of palm wood (although the word can of course also refer to the palm of a hand)
* :white_large_square: A "clear" block could be made of clear plastic
* :droplet: A "water" block could be the same, with the insides waterproof and filled with water part way, or all the way but mixed with particles to show the fluidity
* :large_orange_diamond: An "amber" block could be [molded out of amber resin][amber molding]
* :closed_book: "book" can be an actual (small) book, with the wiring going through the binding or bottom cover
* "stuffed" or "plushie" could be plushie cuboids (like [this][cuboid plushies] but not necessarily animalian)


### Texture

* :cow2: "cow" could have a cow pattern (or be a plushie!)
* :maple_leaf: "leaf" could have leaves embedded under a coat of finish
* :spades: "spades", "clubs", "diamonds", "hearts", and "cards" could be plastered with playing cards, or could be intricately designed in the style of playing cards


### Electric

* :sparkles: "starry", "stars", or "night" could be painted, *or...* they could made to light up with [fiber optics][]!
* :high_brightness: "light", "bright", or "glow" blocks could be made with transparent diffused plastic with LEDs inside
* :traffic_light: "traffic" can have a few colored lights
* :small_red_triangle: "laser" can be clear plastic with a lit up central tube pretending to be a laser


### Attatchments

* :bell: "bells" could contain bells, perhaps inset in little nooks in the sides of the block
* :eyes: "eyes", "watched", or "saw" could have googly eyes attached
* :crown: "crown" can be jeweled and ornamented
* :nut_and_bolt: "mechanical" can use a mechanically inspired font or actually incorporate gears and widgets (as the text or not) for a sort of steampunk look


### Models

* :bread: "bread" can be shaped like a loaf of bread
* :bus: "bus" could be a miniature bus, perhaps even with wheels
* :baby: "crib" could be a miniature crib, with the word set at the bottom or possibly atop some adorable bedding
* :point_right: "hold"/"held"/"holding" could feature a sculpted hand appearing to grasp the next block in the sentence


### Misc. Autological Adjectives

* Many words can include typographical stylizations, e.g. faint, sloppy, **bold**, *fast*/*run*/*italic*/*slanted*/*leaning*, <sup>high,</sup> <sub>low</sub>
* "high" and "low" could be superscript and subscript respectively, but they could also be higher and lower respectively (although that might make them incompatible with postfixes and prefixes)
* ▛ A (preferably 3D) quadrant of "quarter" could be inverted or highlighted, maybe even made out of a different type of wood
* :white_square_button: "internal" could have the word on the inside, at the bottom of a clear plastic block with the wiring moved away from the center, or better yet with a smaller opaque block inside
* :checkered_flag: "checkered" can be checkered
* :anchor: "heavy" can be physically heavy, "light" can be physically light (and their type can be adjusted as well)
* :hotsprings: "smell" could have symbolic wavy markings and/or could be scented in some way


### Special

* ¶ Line/paragraph break connectors that could basically just be cords with the magnets and contacts (or maybe something nicer if possible)
* :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Splitting and joining connectors that let you give the sentences different possible paths at the same time (The brain could then read out load)
* :on: Prefix and postfix blocks, like "-s", "-es", "-ed", "-ing", "-’s", "-y", "-ness", "un-", "super-" (I'm not sure exactly how these will work typographimechanically)
* :lock: "lock" could be a locked container and :key: "key" could have the key on a string


### Impractical

* I could imagine a "slinky" block, but that would be very complicated to create, and while perhaps fun as a block, not particulary useful as a word
* :whale: I can imagine an artistic cuboidal "whale" block with a functioning spout
* :small_red_triangle: "laser" could alternatively actually use a laser to carry the information. It would need a direct channel for power anyways, though, so it would be completely silly.
* "clunky" or "misfit" could be awkwardly different sizes
